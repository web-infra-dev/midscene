This is the documentation for the Midscene (an SDK for AI automation)

In this file you can get a list of all the docs and their links: ./rspress.config.ts

All the english docs are in the `docs/en` folder, and the chinese docs are in the `docs/zh` folder. All the modifications should be synchronized at both places.
