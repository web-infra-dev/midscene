# Integrate with Playwright

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

[Playwright.js](https://playwright.com/) is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft, primarily used for end-to-end testing and web scraping of web applications.

Here we assume you already have a repository with Playwright integration.

:::info Example Project
You can find an example project of Playwright integration here: [https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/playwright-demo](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/playwright-demo)
:::

<SetupEnv />

## Step 1: add dependencies and update configuration

Add dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web --save-dev" />

Update playwright.config.ts

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
+ timeout: 90 * 1000,
+ reporter: [["list"], ["@midscene/web/playwright-report"]],
});
```

## Step 2: extend the `test` instance

Save the following code as `./e2e/fixture.ts`:

```typescript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import type { PlayWrightAiFixtureType } from '@midscene/web/playwright';
import { PlaywrightAiFixture } from '@midscene/web/playwright';

export const test = base.extend<PlayWrightAiFixtureType>(PlaywrightAiFixture({
  waitForNetworkIdleTimeout: 2000, // optional, default is 2000ms
  waitForNavigationTimeout: 5000, // optional, default is 5000ms
}));
```

## Step 3: write test cases

### Basic AI Operation APIs

* `ai` or `aiAction` - General AI interaction
* `aiTap` - Click operation
* `aiHover` - Hover operation
* `aiInput` - Input operation
* `aiKeyboardPress` - Keyboard operation
* `aiScroll` - Scroll operation

### Query

* `aiQuery` - AI Query

### More APIs

* `aiAssert` - AI Assertion
* `aiWaitFor` - AI Wait

You can find more details in [API Reference](./API).

### Example Code

```typescript title="./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts"
import { expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { test } from "./fixture";

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  page.setViewportSize({ width: 400, height: 905 });
  await page.goto("https://www.ebay.com");
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
});

test("search headphone on ebay", async ({ 
  ai, 
  aiQuery, 
  aiAssert,
  aiInput,
  aiTap,
  aiScroll 
}) => {
  // Use aiInput to enter search keyword
  await aiInput('Headphones', 'search box');
  
  // Use aiTap to click search button
  await aiTap('search button');
  
  // Wait for search results to load
  await aiWaitFor('search results list loaded', { timeoutMs: 5000 });
  
  // Use aiScroll to scroll to bottom
  await aiScroll(
    { 
      direction: 'down',
      scrollType: 'untilBottom'
    },
    'search results list'
  );
  
  // Use aiQuery to get product information
  const items = await aiQuery<Array<{title: string, price: number}>>(
    'get product titles and prices from search results'
  );
  
  console.log("headphones in stock", items);
  expect(items?.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  
  // Use aiAssert to verify filter functionality
  await aiAssert("category filter exists on the left side");
});
```

For more Agent API details, please refer to [API Reference](./API).

## Step 4. run test cases

```bash
npx playwright test ./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts
```

## Step 5. view test report

After the command executes successfully, it will output: `Midscene - report file updated: ./current_cwd/midscene_run/report/some_id.html`. Open this file in your browser to view the report.
