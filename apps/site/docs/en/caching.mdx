# Caching

Midscene supports caching the planning steps and matched DOM element information of AI to reduce the call of AI models and improve the execution efficiency.

**Effect**

After enabling the cache, the execution time is significantly reduced, for example, from 39s to 13s.

## Instructions

There are two key points to use caching:

1. Set `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` in the environment variable.
2. Set `cacheId` to specify the cache file name. It's automatically set in Playwright and Yaml mode, but if you are using javascript SDK, you should set it manually.

### Playwright

In playwright mode, you can use the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable to enable caching.

The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the test file name.

```diff
- playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
```

### Javascript agent, like PuppeteerAgent, AgentOverChromeBridge

Enable caching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.
And also, you should set the `cacheId` to specify the cache identifier.

```diff
- tsx demo.ts 
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 tsx demo.ts
```

```javascript
const mid = new PuppeteerAgent(originPage, {
  cacheId: 'puppeteer-swag-sab', // specify cache id
});
```

### Yaml

Enable caching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.
The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the yaml filename.

```diff
- npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
+ # Add cache identifier, cacheId is the yaml filename
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
```

## Cache strategy

### Cache content

These two types of content will be cached:

1. the results of AI's planning (i.e., the results of ai and aiAction methods)
2. The results of AI's element locating

The results of `aiQuery` and `aiAssert` will never be cached. You can always use them to verify whether the AI's task is as expected.

### Cache hit conditions

Cache will only be hit when the following conditions are met:
1. The same `cacheId`
2. The same major and minor version of Midscene
3. The same page url and screen size

When using cache for locate element tasks, the following conditions are also required:
1. A DOM element with the same position and size can be found on the page according to the cache file.
2. If you are using VL model, there must be a DOM element matched with the coordinates. Otherwise, you will see a "POSITION NODE" in report file which means it cannot be cached.

### If cache is not hit

If cache is not hit, Midscene will call AI model again and the result in cache file will be updated.

## Common issues

### Why the cache is missed on CI?

You should commit the cache file to the repository (usually in the `./midscene_run/cache` directory). And also, check the cache-hit conditions.

### How can I ensure my scripts are consistently stable when using a cache?

⁠We have noticed many scenarios where the cache may miss when the page changes, such as when the position changes slightly or the DOM structure changes. We believe caching is a feature that accelerates the local debugging process, rather than a tool for maintaining long-term script stability.

### How to manually remove the cache?

You can remove the cache file in the `cache` directory, or edit the contents in the cache file.
