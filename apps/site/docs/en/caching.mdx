# Caching

Midscene supports caching the planning steps and DOM XPaths to reduce calls to AI models and greatly improve execution efficiency.

Android automation supports planning cache but not element location cache (due to lack of XPath support).

**Effect**

After enabling the cache, the execution time of AI service related steps can be significantly reduced.

## Instructions

There are two key points to use caching:

1. Set `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` in the environment variable to enable matching cache.
2. Set `cacheId` to specify the cache file name. It's automatically set in Playwright and Yaml mode. If you are using javascript SDK, you should set it manually.

### Playwright

When using Playwright integration, you can use the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable to enable caching.

The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the test file name.

```diff
- playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
```

### JavaScript agent, like PuppeteerAgent, AgentOverChromeBridge

You should set the `cacheId` to specify the cache identifier.
And also, you should enable cache-matching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.

```diff
- tsx demo.ts 
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 tsx demo.ts
```

```javascript
const mid = new PuppeteerAgent(originPage, {
  cacheId: 'puppeteer-swag-sab', // specify cache id
});
```

### YAML

Enable cache-matching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.
The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the yaml filename.

```diff
- npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
+ # Add cache identifier, cacheId is the yaml filename
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
```

## Cache strategy

Cache contents will be saved in the `./midscene_run/cache` directory with the `.cache.yaml` as the extension name.

These two types of content will be cached:

1. the result of planning, like calls to `.ai` `.aiAction`
2. The XPaths for elements located by AI, such as `.aiLocate`, `.aiTap`, etc.

The query results like `aiBoolean`, `aiQuery`, `aiAssert` will never be cached. 

If the cache is not hit, Midscene will call AI model again and the result in cache file will be updated.

## Common issues

### No cache file is generated

Make sure you have set the `cacheId` in the constructor.

### How to check if the cache is hit?

You can view the report file. If the cache is hit, you will see the `cache` tip and the time cost is obviously reduced.

### Why the cache is missed on CI?

You should commit the cache file to the repository (which is in the `./midscene_run/cache` directory). And also, check whether the prompt is the same as the one in the cache file.

### Does it mean that AI services are no longer needed after using cache?

No. Caching is the way to accelerate the execution, but it's not a tool for ensuring long-term script stability. We have noticed many scenarios where the cache may miss when the DOM structure changes. AI services are still needed to reevaluate the task when the cache miss occurs.

### How to manually remove the cache?

You can remove the cache file in the `./midscene_run/cache` directory, or edit the contents in the cache file.

### How to disable the cache for a single API?

You can use the `cacheable` option to disable the cache for a single API.

Please refer to the documentation of the corresponding [API](./api.mdx) for details.

### Limitations of XPath in caching element location

Midscene uses [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XPath) to cache the element location. ‚Å†We are using a relatively strict strategy to prevent false matches. In these situations, the cache will not be accessed.

1. The text content of the new element at the same XPath is different from the cached element.
2. The DOM structure of the page is changed from the cached one.

When the cache is not hit, the process will fall back to continue using AI services to find the element.

### Get more debug logs for caching

You can set the `DEBUG=midscene:cache:*` environment variable to get more debug logs for caching.
