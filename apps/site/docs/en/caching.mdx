# Caching

Midscene supports caching the planning steps and matched DOM element information of AI to reduce the call of AI models and improve the execution efficiency.

**Effect**

After enabling the cache, the execution time is significantly reduced, for example, from 39s to 13s.

## Instructions

There are two key points to use caching:

1. Set `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` in the environment variable.
2. Set `cacheId` to specify the cache file name. It's automatically set in Playwright and Yaml mode, but if you are using javascript SDK, you should set it manually.

### Playwright

In playwright mode, you can use the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable to enable caching.

The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the test file name.

```diff
- playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
```

### Javascript agent, like PuppeteerAgent, AgentOverChromeBridge

Enable caching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.
And also, you should set the `cacheId` to specify the cache identifier.

```diff
- tsx demo.ts 
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 tsx demo.ts
```

```javascript
const mid = new PuppeteerAgent(originPage, {
  cacheId: 'puppeteer-swag-sab', // specify cache id
});
```

### Yaml

Enable caching by setting the `MIDSCENE_CACHE=1` environment variable.
The `cacheId` will be automatically set to the yaml filename.

```diff
- npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
+ # Add cache identifier, cacheId is the yaml filename
+ MIDSCENE_CACHE=1 npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
```

## Cache strategy

### Cache content

These two types of content will be cached:

1. the results of AI's planning (i.e., the results of ai and aiAction methods)
2. The results of AI's element locating

The results of `aiQuery` and `aiAssert` will never be cached. You can always use them to verify whether the AI's task is as expected.

### Cache hit conditions

Plan tasks require the following conditions to be hit cache:

1. The same `cacheId`
2. The same `prompt`
3. The same page width and height

Locate tasks require the following conditions to be hit cache:

1. The same `cacheId`
2. The same `prompt`
3. There is an element on the page that matches the description in the cache file's [xpath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XPath) field.

### If cache is not hit

If cache is not hit, Midscene will call AI model again and the result in cache file will be updated.

## Common issues

### Why the cache is missed on CI?

You should commit the cache file to the repository (usually in the `./midscene_run/cache` directory). And also, check the cache-hit conditions.

### Does it mean that AI services are no longer needed after using cache?

No. Caching is not a tool for ensuring long-term script stability. We have noticed many scenarios where the cache may miss when the page changes, such as when the element position changes slightly or the DOM structure changes. AI services are still needed to reevaluate the task when the cache miss occurs.

### How to manually remove the cache?

You can remove the cache file in the `cache` directory, or edit the contents in the cache file.
