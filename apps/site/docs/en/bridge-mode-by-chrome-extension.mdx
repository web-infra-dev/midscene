# Bridge Mode by Chrome Extension

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

The bridge mode in the Midscene Chrome extension is a tool that allows you to use local scripts to control the desktop version of Chrome. Your scripts can connect to either a new tab or the currently active tab.

Using the desktop version of Chrome allows you to reuse all cookies, plugins, page status, and everything else you want. You can work with automation scripts to complete your tasks. This mode is commonly referred to as 'man-in-the-loop' in the context of automation.

:::info Demo Project
you can check the demo project of bridge mode here: [https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/bridge-mode-demo](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/bridge-mode-demo)
:::

## Preparation

1. Config the OpenAI API key, or [customize model and provider](./model-provider.html)

```bash
# replace with your own
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

2. Install [Midscene extension from Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/midscene/gbldofcpkknbggpkmbdaefngejllnief)

## Step 1. install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web tsx --save-dev" />

## Step 2. write scripts

Write and save the following code as `./demo-new-tab.ts`.

```typescript
import { AgentOverChromeBridge } from "@midscene/web/bridge-mode";

const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
Promise.resolve(
  (async () => {
    const agent = new AgentOverChromeBridge();

    // This will connect to a new tab on your desktop Chrome
    // remember to start your chrome extension, click 'allow connection' button. Otherwise you will get an timeout error
    await agent.connectNewTabWithUrl("https://www.bing.com");

    // these are the same as normal Midscene agent
    await agent.ai('type "AI 101" and hit Enter');
    await sleep(3000);

    await agent.aiAssert("there are some search results");
    await agent.destroy();
  })()
);
```

## Step 3. run

Launch your desktop Chrome. Start Midscene extension and switch to 'Bridge Mode' tab. Click "Allow connection".

Run your scripts

```bash
tsx demo-new-tab.ts
```

After executing the script, you should see the status of the Chrome extension switched to 'connected', and a new tab has been opened. Now this tab is controlled by your scripts.

:::info
‚Å†Whether the scripts are run before or after clicking 'Allow connection' in the browser is not significant.
:::

## API

Except [the normal agent interface](./api), `AgentOverChromeBridge` provides some other interfaces to control the desktop Chrome.

:::info
You should always call `connectCurrentTab` or `connectNewTabWithUrl` before doing further actions.

Each of the agent instance can only connect to one tab instance, and it cannot be reconnected after destroy.
:::

### `connectCurrentTab`

Connect to the current active tab on Chrome.

### `connectNewTabWithUrl(ur: string)`

Create a new tab with url and connect to immediately.

### `destroy`

Destroy the connection.

## Use bridge mode in yaml-script

[Yaml scripts](./automate-with-scripts-in-yaml) is a way for developers to write automation scripts in yaml format, which is easy to read and write comparing to javascript.

To use bridge mode in yaml script, set the `bridgeMode` property in the `target` section. If you want to use the current tab, set it to `currentTab`, otherwise set it to `newTabWithUrl`.

For example, the following script will open a new tab by Chrome extension bridge: 

```diff
target:
  url: https://www.bing.com
+ bridgeMode: newTabWithUrl
tasks:
```

Run the script:

```bash
midscene ./bing.yaml
```

Remember to start the chrome extension and click 'Allow connection' button after the script is running.

### Unsupported options

In bridge mode, these options will be ignored (they will follow your desktop browser's settings):
- userAgent
- viewportWidth
- viewportHeight
- viewportScale
- waitForNetworkIdle
- cookie
