# Data Privacy

‚Å†Midscene.js is an open-source project (GitHub: [Midscene](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene/)) under the MIT license. You can see all the codes in the public repository.

When using Midscene.js, your page data (including the screenshot) is sent directly to the AI model provider you choose. No third-party platform will have access to this data. All you need to be concerned about is the data privacy policy of the model provider.

If you prefer building Midscene.js and its Chrome Extension in your own environment instead of using the published versions, you can refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to find building instructions.
