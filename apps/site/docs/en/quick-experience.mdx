# Quick Experience by Chrome Extension

Midscene.js provides a Chrome extension. By using it, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on any webpage, without needing to set up a code project.

‚Å†The extension shares the same code as the npm `@midscene/` packages, so you can think of it as a playground or a way to debug with Midscene.

## Preparation

Prepare an OpenAI API key, we will use it soon.

## Install and config

Install Midscene extension from chrome web store: [Midscene](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/midscene/gbldofcpkknbggpkmbdaefngejllnief)

Start the extension (may be folded by default), setup the config by pasting the config in the K=V format:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-replace-by-your-own"
```

You can also paste the configuration as described in [customize model and provider](./model-provider.html) here.

## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. You can use actions to interact with the page, use queries to extract JSON data, or use assertions to validate. 

You may notice that the extension will provide a playback of actions and a report file to review. This is the same report file you will receive from your automation scripts.

Enjoy !

## Want to write some code ?

After experiencing, you may want to write some code to integrate Midscene. There are multiple ways to do that. Please refer to the documents below:

* [Automate with Scripts in YAML](./automate-with-scripts-in-yaml)
* [Integrate with Puppeteer](./integrate-with-puppeteer)
* [Integrate with Playwright](./integrate-with-playwright)


## FAQ

* Extension fails to run and shows 'Cannot access a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension'

It's mainly due to conflicts with other extensions injecting `<iframe />` or `<script />` into the page. Try disabling the suspicious plugins and refresh. 

To find the suspicious plugins:
 
1. Open the Devtools of the page, find the `<script>` or `<iframe>` with a url like `chrome-extension://{ID-of-the-suspicious-plugin}/...`.
2. Copy the ID from the url, open chrome://extensions/, find the plugin with the same ID, disable it.
3. Refresh the page, try again.
