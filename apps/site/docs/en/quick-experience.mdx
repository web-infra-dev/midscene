# Quick Experience by Chrome Extension

Midscene.js provides a Chrome extension. By using it, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on any webpage, without needing to set up a code project.

⁠The extension shares the same code as the npm `@midscene/web` packages, so you can think of it as a playground or a way to debug with Midscene.

## FAQ

### Extension fails to run and shows 'Cannot access a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension'

It's mainly due to conflicts with other extensions injecting `<iframe />` or `<script />` into the page. Try disabling the suspicious plugins and refresh.

To find the suspicious plugins:

1. Open the Devtools of the page, find the `<script>` or `<iframe>` with a url like `chrome-extension://{ID-of-the-suspicious-plugin}/...`.
2. Copy the ID from the url, open `chrome://extensions/` , use cmd+f to find the plugin with the same ID, disable it.
3. Refresh the page, try again.
