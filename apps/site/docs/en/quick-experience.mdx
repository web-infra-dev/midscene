# Quick Experience by Chrome Extension

Midscene.js provides a Chrome extension. By using it, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on any webpage, without needing to set up a code project.

‚Å†The extension shares the same code as the npm `@midscene/` packages, so you can think of it as a playground or a way to debug with Midscene.

## Preparation

Prepare an API key from one of these models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Qwen-2.5-VL, UI-TARS, or any other supported providers. We will be using it soon.

You can check the supported models in [Choose a model](./choose-a-model)

## Install and config

Install Midscene extension from chrome web store: [Midscene](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/midscene/gbldofcpkknbggpkmbdaefngejllnief)

Start the extension (may be folded by Chrome extension icon), setup the config by pasting the config in the K=V format:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-replace-by-your-own"
# ...all other configs here (if any)
```

## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. There are three main tabs in the extension:

- **Action**: use action to interact with the web page, like "type Midscene in the search box" or "click the login button".
- **Query**: use query to extract JSON data from the web page, like "extract the user id from the page, return in \{ id: string \}".
- **Assert**: use assert to validate the web page, like "the page title is "Midscene"".

Enjoy !

## Want to write some code ?

After experiencing, you may want to write some code to integrate Midscene. There are multiple ways to do that. Please refer to the documents below:

* [Automate with Scripts in YAML](./automate-with-scripts-in-yaml)
* [Bridge Mode by Chrome Extension](./bridge-mode-by-chrome-extension)
* [Integrate with Puppeteer](./integrate-with-puppeteer)
* [Integrate with Playwright](./integrate-with-playwright)

## FAQ

### Extension fails to run and shows 'Cannot access a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension'

It's mainly due to conflicts with other extensions injecting `<iframe />` or `<script />` into the page. Try disabling the suspicious plugins and refresh. 

To find the suspicious plugins:
 
1. Open the Devtools of the page, find the `<script>` or `<iframe>` with a url like `chrome-extension://{ID-of-the-suspicious-plugin}/...`.
2. Copy the ID from the url, open `chrome://extensions/` , use cmd+f to find the plugin with the same ID, disable it.
3. Refresh the page, try again.
