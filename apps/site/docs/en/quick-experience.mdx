# Experience By Chrome Extension

Midscene.js provides a Chrome extension. By using it, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on any webpage, without needing to set up a code project.

‚Å†The extension shares the same code as the npm `@midscene/` packages, so you can think of it as a playground or a way to debug with Midscene.

## Preparation

Prepare an OpenAI API key, we will use it soon.

## Install and config

Install Midscene extension from chrome web store: [Midscene](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/midscene/gbldofcpkknbggpkmbdaefngejllnief)

Start the extension (may be folded by default), setup the config by pasting the config in the K=V format:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-replace-by-your-own"
```

You can also paste the configuration as described in [customize model provider](./model-provider.html) here.

## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. You can use actions to interact with the page, use queries to extract JSON data, or use assertions to validate. 

You may notice that the extension will provide a playback of actions and a report file to review. This is the same report file you will receive from your automation scripts.

Enjoy !
