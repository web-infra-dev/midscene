# PC Desktop Automation Support

Midscene can drive native keyboard and mouse controls to support PC desktop automation on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

By leveraging a visual model solution, the automation process works with any desktop application—whether built with Electron, Qt, WPF, or native technologies. Developers only need to focus on the final user experience when debugging UI automation scripts.

The PC desktop automation solution comes with all the features of Midscene:

- Supports zero-code trial using Playground
- Supports JavaScript SDK for scripting
- Supports automation scripts in YAML format and command-line tools
- Supports HTML reports to replay all operation paths
- Works across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- Multi-display support for complex setups

### AI-Powered Automation

Using Midscene's AI capabilities, you can automate desktop applications with natural language:

await agent.aiAct('click on Save As');
await agent.aiAct('type "my-document" in the filename field');
await agent.aiAct('press Enter');
```

## Use Cases

- **Desktop Application Testing**: Automate testing for Electron, Qt, or native apps
- **Workflow Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks across desktop applications
- **Cross-app Integration**: Control multiple applications in sequence
- **UI Testing**: Test desktop applications with natural language descriptions
