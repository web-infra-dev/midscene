# FAQ

## Can Midscene smartly plan the actions according to my one-line goal? Like executing "Tweet 'hello world'"

It's only recommended to use this kind of goal-oriented prompt when you are using GUI agent models like *UI-TARS*.

## Why does Midscene require developers to provide detailed steps while other AI agents are demonstrating "autonomous planning"? Is this an outdated approach?

Midscene has a lot of tool developers, who are more concerned with the stability and performance of UI automation tools. To ensure that the Agent can run accurately in complex systems, clear prompts are still the optimal solution.

To further improve stability, we also provide features like Instant Action interface, Playback Report, and Playground. They may seem traditional and not AI-like, but after extensive practice, we believe these features are the real key to improving efficiency.

If you are interested in "smart GUI Agent", you can check out [UI-TARS](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars), which Midscene also supports.

## Limitations

There are some limitations with Midscene. We are still working on them.

1. The interaction types are limited to only tap, hover, drag (in UI-TARS model only), type, keyboard press, and scroll.
2. AI model is not 100% stable. Following the [Prompting Tips](./prompting-tips) will help improve stability.
3. You cannot interact with the elements inside the cross-origin iframe and canvas when using GPT-4o. This is not a problem when using Qwen and UI-TARS model.
4. We cannot access the native elements of Chrome, like the right-click context menu or file upload dialog.
5. Do not use Midscene to bypass CAPTCHA. Some LLM services are set to decline requests that involve CAPTCHA-solving (e.g., OpenAI), while the DOM of some CAPTCHA pages is not accessible by regular web scraping methods. Therefore, using Midscene to bypass CAPTCHA is not a reliable method.

## Which models are supported?

Please refer to [Choose a model](./choose-a-model).

## What data is sent to AI model?

The screenshot will be sent to the AI model. If you are using GPT-4o, some key information extracted from the DOM will also be sent.

## The automation process is running more slowly than the traditional one

When using general-purpose LLM in Midscene.js, the running time may increase by a factor of 3 to 10 compared to traditional Playwright scripts, for instance from 5 seconds to 20 seconds. To make the result more stable, the token and time cost is inevitable.

There are two ways to improve the running time:
1. Use a dedicated model and deploy it yourself, like UI-TARS. This is the recommended way. Read more about it in [Choose a model](./choose-a-model).
2. Use caching to reduce the token cost. Read more about it in [Caching](./caching).

## The webpage continues to flash when running in headed mode

It's common when the viewport `deviceScaleFactor` does not match your system settings. Setting it to 2 in OSX will solve the issue.

```typescript
await page.setViewport({
  deviceScaleFactor: 2,
});
```

## Where are the report files saved?

The report files are saved in `./midscene-run/report/` by default.

## How can I learn about Midscene's working process?

⁠By reviewing the report file after running the script, you can gain an overview of how Midscene works.
