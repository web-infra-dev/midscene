# Quick experience with Android Playground

With the Midscene.js Android Playground you can try the main Midscene features on a real Android device without writing any code.

The Playground reuses the code from the `@midscene/android` package, so you can treat it as both a playground and a debugging tool for the Android SDK.

## Preparation

### Prepare an API key

Have an API key for a visual-language (VL) model ready. You will need it later. See [Model strategy](./model-strategy) for the supported choices.

### Install adb

`adb` is the command-line tool used to communicate with Android devices. Install it via one of the following options:

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Install the [Android command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only).

Verify `adb` is available:

```bash
adb --version
```

If it succeeds you will see output similar to:

```log
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 34.0.4-10411341
Installed as /usr/local/bin//adb
Running on Darwin 24.3.0 (arm64)
```

### Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable

Follow the [Android environment variable guide](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables) and set `ANDROID_HOME`.

You can confirm it is set by printing the variable:

```bash
echo $ANDROID_HOME
```

Any output means the variable is configured, for example:

```log
/Users/your_username/Library/Android/sdk
```

### Connect the Android device with adb

Enable **USB debugging** (and **USB debugging (Security settings)** if present) inside the developer options on the device, then connect it over USB.

</p>

Check the connection:

```bash
adb devices -l
```

Successful output looks like this:

```log
List of devices attached
s4ey59	device usb:34603008X product:cezanne model:M2006J device:cezan transport_id:3
```

## Start the Playground

```bash
npx --yes @midscene/android-playground
```

## Configure API keys

Click the gear icon to open the configuration panel:
