## Troubleshooting Model Service Connectivity Issues

If you want to troubleshoot connectivity issues, you can use the 'connectivity-test' folder in our example project: [https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/connectivity-test](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/connectivity-test)

Put your `.env` file in the `connectivity-test` folder, and run the test with `npm i && npm run test`.
