## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. There are three main tabs in the extension:

- **Action**: use action to interact with the web page, like "type Midscene in the search box" or "click the login button".
- **Query**: use query to extract JSON data from the web page, like "extract the user id from the page, return in \{ id: string \}".
- **Assert**: use assert to validate the web page, like "the page title is "Midscene"".

Enjoy !
