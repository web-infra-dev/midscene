After configuration, you can start using Midscene right away. It provides several key operation tabs:

- **Act**: interact with the page. This is Auto Planning, corresponding to `aiAct`. For example:
```
Type “Midscene” in the search box, run the search, and open the first result
```

```
Fill out the registration form and make sure every field passes validation
```

- **Query**: extract JSON data from the interface, corresponding to `aiQuery`.

Similar methods include `aiBoolean()`, `aiNumber()`, and `aiString()` for directly extracting booleans, numbers, and strings.

```
Extract the user ID from the page and return JSON data in the { id: string } structure
```

- **Assert**: understand the page and assert; if the condition is not met, throw an error, corresponding to `aiAssert`.

```
There is a login button on the page, with a user agreement link below it
```

- **Tap**: click on an element. This is Instant Action, corresponding to `aiTap`.
```
Click the login button
```

> For the difference between Auto Planning and Instant Action, see the [API](../api.mdx) document.
