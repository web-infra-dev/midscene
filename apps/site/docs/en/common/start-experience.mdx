## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. It provides multiple key operation tabs, including but not limited to:

- **Action**: interact with the web page. This is also known as "Auto Planning". For example:
```
type Midscene in the search box
click the login button
```

- **Query**: extract JSON data from the web page

```
extract the user id from the page, return in \{ id: string \}
```

- **Assert**: validate the page

```
the page title is "Midscene"
```

- **Tap**: perform a single tap on the element where you want to click. This is also known as "Instant Action".

```
the login button
```

All Agent APIs can be directly debugged and run in the Playground! Interactive, extraction, and verification methods are fully covered, with visual operations and verification that boost your automation development efficiency!

Enjoy !

> For the different between "Auto Planning" and "Instant Action", please refer to the [API](../api.mdx) document.
