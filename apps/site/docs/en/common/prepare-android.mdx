## Preparation

### Install Node.js

Install [Node.js 18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Prepare API Key

Prepare an API Key for a Vision Language (VL) model.

You can check the models and configurations supported by Midscene.js in the [Model Strategy](../model-strategy) documentation.

### Install adb

`adb` is a command-line tool that allows you to communicate with Android devices. There are two ways to install `adb`:

- Method 1: Install using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Method 2: Install using [Android Command Line Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only)

Verify that `adb` is installed successfully:

```bash
adb --version
```

When you see the following output, it means `adb` is installed successfully:

```log
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 34.0.4-10411341
Installed as /usr/local/bin//adb
Running on Darwin 24.3.0 (arm64) 
```

### Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable

Refer to [Android Environment Variables](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables) to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.

Verify that the `ANDROID_HOME` variable is set successfully:

```bash
echo $ANDROID_HOME
```

When the above command has output, it means the `ANDROID_HOME` variable is set successfully:

```log
/Users/your_username/Library/Android/sdk
```

### Connect Android Device

In the developer options of your Android device, enable 'USB debugging'. If 'USB debugging (Security settings)' exists, enable it as well. Then connect your Android device using a USB cable.

```log
