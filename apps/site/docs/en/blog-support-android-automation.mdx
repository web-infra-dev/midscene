# Support Android Automation

From Midscene v0.15.0, we are happy to announce the support for Android automation!

## Demos first

Here are some demos to show you the power of the automation:

### Maps navigation to attraction

### Twitter auto-like

## Suitable for ALL apps

For our developers, all you need is the adb connection and a visual-language model (vl-model) service. Everything is ready!

Behind the scenes, we utilize the visual grounding capabilities of vl-model to locate target elements on the screen. So, regardless of whether it's a native app or a hybrid app with a webview, it makes no difference. Developers can write automation scripts without the burden of worrying about the technology stack of the app.

## With ALL the power of Midscene

When using Midscene to do web automation, our users loves the tools like playgrounds and reports. Now, we bring the same power to Android automation!

### Use the playground to run automation without any code

### Use the report to replay the whole process

### Write the automation scripts by yaml file

```yaml 
# search headphone on ebay, extract the items info into a json file, and assert the shopping cart icon

android:
  deviceId: s4ey59ytbitot4yp

tasks:
  - name: search headphones
    flow:
      - aiAction: open browser and navigate to ebay.com
      - aiAction: type 'Headphones' in ebay search box, hit Enter
      - sleep: 5000
      - aiAction: scroll down the page for 800px

  - name: extract headphones info
    flow:
      - aiQuery: >
          {name: string, price: number, subTitle: string}[], return item name, price and the subTitle on the lower right corner of each item
        name: headphones

  - name: assert Filter button
    flow:
      - aiAssert: There is a Filter button on the page
```

### Use the javascript SDK

```ts 
import { AndroidAgent, AndroidDevice, getConnectedDevices } from '@midscene/android';
import "dotenv/config"; // read environment variables from .env file

const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
Promise.resolve(
  (async () => {
    const devices = await getConnectedDevices();
    const page = new AndroidDevice(devices[0].udid);

    // 👀 init Midscene agent
    const agent = new AndroidAgent(page,{
      aiActionContext:
        'If any location, permission, user agreement, etc. popup, click agree. If login page pops up, close it.',
    });
    await page.connect();
    await page.launch('https://www.ebay.com');

    await sleep(5000);

    // 👀 type keywords, perform a search
    await agent.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');

    // 👀 wait for the loading
    await agent.aiWaitFor("there is at least one headphone item on page");
    // or you may use a plain sleep:
    // await sleep(5000);

    // 👀 understand the page content, find the items
    const items = await agent.aiQuery(
      "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
    );
    console.log("headphones in stock", items);

    // 👀 assert by AI
    await agent.aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");
  })()
);

```

### Two style APIs to do interaction

The auto-planning style:

```javascript
await agent.ai('input "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');
```

The instant action style:

```javascript
await agent.aiInput('Headphones', 'search box');
await agent.aiKeyboardPress('Enter');
```

### Demo projects

We have prepared a demo project for javascript SDK:

[JavaScript demo project](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/android/javascript-sdk-demo)

If you want to use the automation for testing purpose, you can use the javascript with vitest. We have setup a demo project for you to see how it works:

[Vitest demo project](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/android/vitest-demo)

You can also write the automation scripts by yaml file:

[YAML demo project](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/android/yaml-scripts-demo)

## Limitations

1. Caching feature for element locator is not supported. Since no view-hierarchy is collected, we cannot cache the element identifier and reuse it.
2. LLMs like gpt-4o or deepseek are not supported. Only some known vl models with visual grounding ability are supported for now. If you want to introduce other vl models, please let us know.
3. The performance is not good enough for now. We are still working on it.
4. The vl model may not perform well on `.aiQuery` and `.aiAssert`. We will give a way to switch model for different kinds of tasks.

## Credits

We would like to thank the following projects:

- [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and [yume-chan](https://github.com/yume-chan) allow us to control Android devices with browser.
- [appium-adb](https://github.com/appium/appium-adb) for the javascript bridge of adb.
- [YADB](https://github.com/ysbing/YADB) for the yadb tool which improves the performance of text input.
