# Quick experience with iOS Playground

With the Midscene.js iOS Playground you can try the main Midscene features on a real iOS device without writing any code.

The Playground shares code with the `@midscene/ios` package, so you can treat it as both a playground and a debugging assistant for the iOS SDK.
