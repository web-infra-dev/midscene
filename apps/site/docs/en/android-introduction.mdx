# Android Automation Support

Midscene can drive adb tools to support Android automation.

By adapting a visual model solution, the automation process works with any app tech stack—whether built with Native, Flutter, React Native, or Lynx. Developers only need to focus on the final experience when debugging UI automation scripts.

The Android UI automation solution comes with all the features of Midscene:

- Supports zero-code trial using Playground.
- Supports JavaScript SDK.
- Supports automation scripts in YAML format and command-line tools.
- Supports HTML reports to replay all operation paths.
