![](/blog/logScreenshot-api.png)

* Example:

```javascript
test('login github', async ({ ai, aiAssert, aiInput, logScreenshot }) => {
  if (CACHE_TIME_OUT) {
    test.setTimeout(200 * 1000);
  }
  await ai('Click the "Sign in" button');
  await aiInput('quanru', 'username');
  await aiInput('123456', 'password');

  // log by your own
  await logScreenshot('Login page', {
    content: 'Username is quanru, password is 123456',
  });

  await ai('Click the "Sign in" button');
  await aiAssert('Login success');
});
```

## v0.17 - Let AI see the DOM of the page

### Data query API enhanced

To meet more automation and data extraction scenarios, the following APIs have been enhanced with the `options` parameter, supporting more flexible DOM information and screenshots:

- `agent.aiQuery(dataDemand, options)`
- `agent.aiBoolean(prompt, options)`
- `agent.aiNumber(prompt, options)`
- `agent.aiString(prompt, options)`

#### New `options` parameter

- `domIncluded`: Whether to pass the simplified DOM information to AI model, default is off. This is useful for extracting attributes that are not visible on the page, like image links.
- `screenshotIncluded`: Whether to pass the screenshot to AI model, default is on.

#### Code example

```typescript
// Extract all contact information (including hidden avatarUrl attributes)
const contactsData = await agent.aiQuery(
  "{name: string, id: number, company: string, department: string, avatarUrl: string}[], extract all contact information including hidden avatarUrl attributes",
  { domIncluded: true }
);

// Check if the id attribute of the first contact is 1
const isId1 = await agent.aiBoolean(
  "Is the first contact's id is 1?",
  { domIncluded: true }
);

// Get the ID of the first contact (hidden attribute)
const firstContactId = await agent.aiNumber("First contact's id?", { domIncluded: true });

// Get the avatar URL of the first contact (invisible attribute on the page)
const avatarUrl = await agent.aiString(
  "What is the Avatar URL of the first contact?",
  { domIncluded: true }
);
```

### New right-click ability

Have you ever encountered a scenario where you need to automate a right-click operation? Now, Midscene supports a new `agent.aiRightClick()` method!

#### Function

Perform a right-click operation on the specified element, suitable for scenarios where right-click events are customized on web pages. Please note that Midscene cannot interact with the browser's native context menu after right-click.

#### Parameter description

- `locate`: Describe the element you want to operate in natural language
- `options`: Optional, supports `deepThink` (AI fine-grained positioning) and `cacheable` (result caching)

#### Example

```typescript
// Right-click on a contact in the contacts application, triggering a custom context menu
await agent.aiRightClick("Alice Johnson");

// Then you can click on the options in the menu
await agent.aiTap("Copy Info"); // Copy contact information to the clipboard
```

### A complete example

In this report file, we show a complete example of using the new `aiRightClick` API and new query parameters to extract contact data including hidden attributes.
