# Automate with Scripts in YAML

In most cases, developers write automation scripts just to perform some smoke tests, like checking for the appearance of certain content or verifying that a key user path is accessible. In such situations, maintaining a large test project is unnecessary.

Midscene offers a way to perform automation using `.yaml` files, which helps you focus on the script itself rather than the testing framework. This allows any team member to write automation scripts without needing to learn any API.

Here is an example. By reading its content, you should be able to understand how it works.

```yaml
web:
  url: https://www.bing.com

tasks:
  - name: Search for weather
    flow:
      - ai: Search for "today's weather"
      - sleep: 3000

  - name: Check results
    flow:
      - aiAssert: The results show weather information
```

:::info Sample Project

You can find a sample project that uses YAML scripts for automation here:

- [Web](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/yaml-scripts-demo)
- [Android](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/android/yaml-scripts-demo)

:::

<SetupEnv />

Alternatively, you can use a `.env` file in the same directory where you run the command to store your configuration. The Midscene command-line tool will automatically load it when running a YAML script.

```env filename=.env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

## Install the Command-Line Tool

Install `@midscene/cli` globally:

```bash
npm i -g @midscene/cli
# Or install it within your project
npm i @midscene/cli --save-dev
```

Create a file named `bing-search.yaml` to drive a web browser automation task:

```yaml
web:
  url: https://www.bing.com

tasks:
  - name: Search for weather
    flow:
      - ai: Search for "today's weather"
      - sleep: 3000
      - aiAssert: The results show weather information
```

Or, to drive an Android device automation task (requires the device to be connected via adb):

```yaml
android:
  # launch: https://www.bing.com
  deviceId: s4ey59

tasks:
  - name: Search for weather
    flow:
      - ai: Open the browser and navigate to bing.com
      - ai: Search for "today's weather"
      - sleep: 3000
      - aiAssert: The results show weather information
```

Run the script:

```bash
midscene ./bing-search.yaml
# Or if you installed midscene in your project
npx midscene ./bing-search.yaml
```

You should see the script's execution progress and a link to the visual report file.

## Command-Line Tool Usage

`@midscene/cli` provides flexible ways to run your automation scripts.

### Run One or More Scripts

You can pass a single `.yaml` script file or use a glob pattern to match multiple `.yaml` files to the `midscene` command.

```bash
# Run a single script
midscene ./bing-search.yaml

# Use a glob pattern to run all matching scripts
midscene './scripts/**/*.yaml'
```

### Use an Index File for Orchestration

For more complex scenarios, you can use an index `.yaml` file to define a complete execution plan. This gives you better control over concurrency, error handling, and configuration sharing.

```bash
midscene ./index.yaml
```

### Command-Line Options

Whether you run script files directly or use an index file, you can control the execution behavior with command-line options. If the same configuration is defined in the index file, the command-line options will take precedence.

- `--concurrent <number>`: Sets the number of concurrent executions. Defaults to `1`.
- `--continue-on-error`: If this flag is set, it will continue to run the remaining scripts even if one fails.
- `--share-browser-context`: Shares the same browser context (e.g., Cookies and `localStorage`) across all scripts. This is very useful for sequential tests that require a login state.
- `--summary <filename>`: Specifies the path for the generated summary report file.
- `--headed`: Runs the script in a browser with a graphical user interface, rather than in headless mode.
- `--keep-window`: Keeps the browser window open after the script execution is complete. This option automatically enables `--headed` mode.

```bash
# Run all scripts with a concurrency of 4 and continue on error
midscene './scripts/**/*.yaml' --concurrent 4 --continue-on-error

# Run the index file but override its concurrency setting to 10
midscene ./index.yaml --concurrent 10
```

## `.yaml` File Structure

Midscene supports two types of `.yaml` files, which can be combined to achieve flexible automation workflows.

### 1. Single Script Files

A script file is where you define the specific automation tasks to be executed. It specifies the target to be manipulated (like a webpage or an Android app) and the series of steps to perform.

A standard `.yaml` script file includes a `web` or `android` section, and a `tasks` section.

```yaml
# The web or android section defines the automation target
web:
  url: https://www.bing.com

# The tasks section defines the series of steps to be executed
tasks:
  - name: Search for weather
    flow:
      - ai: Search for "today's weather"
      - sleep: 3000
      - aiAssert: The results show weather information
```

### 2. Multi-Script Files

A multi-script file acts as an entry point for organizing and managing the batch execution of multiple script files. It does not contain specific `tasks` but instead defines which script files to execute and the rules for their execution.

A multi-script file contains the following parts:

```yaml
# Defines the list of files to execute, supports glob patterns
files:
  - './scripts/login.yaml'
  - './scripts/search.yaml'
  - './scripts/**/*.yaml'

# Number of concurrent executions, defaults to 1
# Can be overridden by the --concurrent command-line option
concurrent: 2

# Whether to continue executing other files on error, defaults to false
# Can be overridden by the --continue-on-error command-line option
continueOnError: true

# Whether to share the browser context, defaults to false
# Can be overridden by the --share-browser-context command-line option
shareBrowserContext: true

# Global web configuration (only url and serve fields can be overridden by individual file configurations)
web:
  userAgent: 'Custom User Agent'
  viewportWidth: 1920
  viewportHeight: 1080

# Global android configuration (only the launch field can be overridden by individual file configurations)
android:
  deviceId: 'your-device-id'
```

#### Configuration Description

- **files**: Required, defines the list of script files to execute, supports glob pattern matching.
- **concurrent**: Optional, the number of files to execute concurrently, defaults to 1.
- **continueOnError**: Optional, whether to continue executing other files when one fails, defaults to `false`.
- **shareBrowserContext**: Optional, whether to share the browser context across all scripts, defaults to `false`.
- **summary**: Optional, specifies the path for the generated summary report file.
- **web**: Optional, global web configuration. Note: Only the `url` and `serve` fields can be overridden by individual YAML file configurations; other fields serve as fixed global settings.
- **android**: Optional, global android configuration. Note: Only the `launch` field can be overridden by individual YAML file configurations; other fields serve as fixed global settings.

#### Advantages of Using Multi-Script Files

1.  **Centralized Management**: Define complex execution plans in a single file.
2.  **Configuration Reuse**: Global configurations can be shared by all files, reducing redundant setup.
3.  **Aggregated Results**: Automatically generates a summary report containing the results of all executions.

Running a multi-script file:

```bash
midscene ./index.yaml

# Also supports --headed and --keep-window options
midscene ./index.yaml --headed
```

### Execution Artifacts

After execution is complete, the following files will be generated in the output directory:

- An aggregated `index.json` file (or the file specified by the `--summary` option), containing the execution status and statistics of all files.
- The individual execution results of each YAML file (in JSON format).
- The visual reports for each file (in HTML format).

### The `web` part

```yaml
web:
  # The URL to visit, required. If `serve` is provided, provide the relative path.
  url: <url>

  # Serve a local path as a static server, optional.
  serve: <root-directory>

  # The browser user agent, optional.
  userAgent: <ua>

  # The browser viewport width, optional, defaults to 1280.
  viewportWidth: <width>

  # The browser viewport height, optional, defaults to 960.
  viewportHeight: <height>

  # Whether to close newly created tabs when the bridge disconnects, optional, defaults to false.
  closeNewTabsAfterDisconnect: <boolean>

  # Whether to ignore HTTPS certificate errors, optional, defaults to false.
  acceptInsecureCerts: <boolean>

  # Background knowledge to send to the AI model when calling aiAction, optional.
  aiActionContext: <string>
```

### The `android` part

  deviceId: <device-id>

  # The launch URL, optional, defaults to the device's current page.
  launch: <url>

  # The path to the JSON file for outputting aiQuery/aiAssert results, optional.
  output: <path-to-output-file>
```

### The `tasks` part

The `tasks` part is an array that defines the steps of the script. Remember to add a `-` before each step to indicate it's an array item.

The interfaces in the `flow` section are almost identical to the [API](./api.html), with some differences in parameter nesting levels.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: <name>
    continueOnError: <boolean> # Optional, whether to continue to the next task on error, defaults to false.
    flow:
      # Auto Planning (.ai)

## More Features

### Using Environment Variables in `.yaml` Files

You can use environment variables in your `.yaml` files with the `${variable-name}` syntax.

For example, if you have a `.env` file with the following content:

```env filename=.env
topic=weather today
```

You can use the environment variable in your `.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
#...
- ai: type ${topic} in input box
#...
```

### Running in Headed Mode

> `web` scenarios only

'Headed' mode means the browser window will be visible. By default, scripts run in headless mode.

To run in headed mode, you can use the `--headed` option. Additionally, if you want to keep the browser window open after the script finishes, you can use the `--keep-window` option. The `--keep-window` option automatically enables `--headed` mode.

Headed mode consumes more resources, so it is recommended to use it only locally.

```bash
# Run in headed mode
midscene /path/to/yaml --headed

# Run in headed mode and keep the browser window open afterward
midscene /path/to/yaml --keep-window
```

### Using Bridge Mode

> `web` scenarios only

By using bridge mode, you can leverage YAML scripts to automate your existing desktop browser. This is particularly useful for reusing cookies, plugins, and page states, or for interacting manually with automation scripts.

To use bridge mode, you first need to install the Chrome extension and then use the following configuration in the `target` section:

```diff
web:
  url: https://www.bing.com
+ bridgeMode: newTabWithUrl
```

Please refer to [Bridge Mode via Chrome Extension](./bridge-mode-by-chrome-extension) for more details.

### Running YAML Scripts with JavaScript

You can also run a YAML script using JavaScript by calling the [`runYaml`](./api.html#runyaml) method on the Agent. Note that this method will only execute the `tasks` part of the YAML script.

## Configure dotenv's Default Behavior

Midscene uses [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Disable dotenv's Debug Logs

By default, Midscene prints debug information from dotenv. If you don't want to see this information, you can use the `--dotenv-debug` option to disable it.

```bash
midscene /path/to/yaml --dotenv-debug=false
```

### Use .env to Override Global Environment Variables

By default, `dotenv` will not override global environment variables with the same name found in the `.env` file. If you want to override them, you can use the `--dotenv-override` option.

```bash
midscene /path/to/yaml --dotenv-override=true
```
