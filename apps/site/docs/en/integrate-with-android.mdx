you can check the demo project of Android here: [https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/android-demo](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/blob/main/android-demo)

There is also a demo of Android with Vitest: [https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/android-with-vitest-demo](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene-example/tree/main/android-with-vitest-demo)

## Preparation

### Config OpenAI API Key

Config the OpenAI API key, or [config model and provider](./model-provider)

```bash
# replace with your own
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

### Prepare adb environment

- way 1: use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=zh-cn) to install
- way 2: use [Android command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only) to install

Verify adb is installed successfully:

```bash
adb --version
```

Output like this, means adb is installed successfully

```bash
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 34.0.4-10411341
Installed as /usr/local/bin//adb
Running on Darwin 24.3.0 (arm64)
```

### Connect Android device with adb

Open the USB debugging on the Android device, and then connect the Android device with a USB cable

Verify the connection:

```bash
adb devices -l
```

Output like this, means the connection is successful

```bash
List of devices attached
s4ey59ytbitot4yp	device usb:34603008X product:cezanne model:M2006J10C device:cezanne transport_id:3
```

## Step 1. Install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/android --save-dev" />

## Step 2. Write scripts

Write the following code, and save it as `./demo.ts`

```typescript title="./demo.ts"
import { AndroidAgent, AndroidDevice, getConnectedDevices } from '@midscene/android';

const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
Promise.resolve(
  (async () => {
    const devices = await getConnectedDevices();
    const page = new AndroidDevice(devices[0].udid);

    // ðŸ‘€ init Midscene agent
    const agent = new AndroidAgent(page,{
      aiActionContext:
        'If any location, permission, user agreement, etc. popup, click agree. If login page pops up, close it.',
    });
    await page.connect();

    // ðŸ‘€ open browser and navigate to ebay.com (Please ensure that the current page has a browser app)
    await agent.aiAction('open browser and navigate to ebay.com');

    await sleep(5000);

    // ðŸ‘€ type keywords, perform a search
    await agent.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');

    // ðŸ‘€ wait for loading completed
    await agent.aiWaitFor("There is at least one headphone product");
    // or you can use a normal sleep:
    // await sleep(5000);

    // ðŸ‘€ understand the page content, extract data
    const items = await agent.aiQuery(
      "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
    );
    console.log("headphones in stock", items);

    // ðŸ‘€ assert by AI
    await agent.aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");
  })()
);

```

## Step 3. run

Using `tsx` to run, you will get the data of Headphones on eBay:

```bash
# run
npx tsx demo.ts

# it should print 
#  [
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'Beats by Dr. Dre Studio Buds Totally Wireless Noise Cancelling In Ear + OPEN BOX',
#     price: 505.15
#   },
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'Skullcandy Indy Truly Wireless Earbuds-Headphones Green Mint',
#     price: 186.69
#   }
# ]
```

For the agent's more APIs, please refer to [API](./API).

## Step 4: view the report

After the above command executes successfully, the console will output: `Midscene - report file updated: /path/to/report/some_id.html`. You can open this file in a browser to view the report.
