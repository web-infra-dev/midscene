## Features

### Write Automation with Natural Language
- Describe your goals and steps, and Midscene will plan and operate the user interface for you.
- Use Javascript SDK or YAML to write your automation script.

### Web & Mobile App & Any Interface
- **Web Automation**: Either [integrate with Puppeteer](./integrate-with-puppeteer), [with Playwright](./integrate-with-playwright) or use [Bridge Mode](./bridge-mode) to control your desktop browser.
- **Android Automation**: Use [Javascript SDK](./android-getting-started) with adb to control your local Android device.
- **iOS Automation**: Use [Javascript SDK](./ios-getting-started) with WebDriverAgent to control your local iOS devices and simulators.
- **Any Interface Automation**: Use [Javascript SDK](./integrate-with-any-interface) to control your own interface.

### For Developers
- **Three kinds of APIs**:
  - [Interaction API](./api#interaction-methods): interact with the user interface.
  - [Data Extraction API](./api#data-extraction): extract data from the user interface and dom.
  - [Utility API](./api#more-apis): utility functions like `aiAssert()`, `aiLocate()`, `aiWaitFor()`.
- **MCP**: Midscene provides MCP services that expose atomic Midscene Agent actions as MCP tools so upper-layer agents can inspect and operate UIs with natural language. [Docs](./mcp)
- [**Caching for Efficiency**](./caching): Replay your script with cache and get the result faster.
- **Debugging Experience**: Midscene.js offers a visualized replay back report file, a built-in playground, and a Chrome Extension to simplify the debugging process. These are the tools most developers truly need.


## Showcases

We've prepared some showcases for you to learn the use of Midscene.js.

1. Use JS code to drive task orchestration, collect information about Jay Chou's concert, and write it into Google Docs (By UI-TARS model)

2. Control Maps App on Android (By Qwen-2.5-VL model)

3. Using midscene mcp to browse the page (https://www.saucedemo.com/), perform login, add products, place orders, and finally generate test cases based on mcp execution steps and playwright example

## Zero-code quick experience

- **[Chrome Extension](./quick-experience)**: Start in-browser experience immediately through [the Chrome Extension](./quick-experience), without writing any code.
- **[Android Playground](./android-getting-started#try-playground-no-code)**: There is also a built-in Android playground to control your local Android device.
- **[iOS Playground](./ios-getting-started#try-playground)**: There is also a built-in iOS playground to control your local iOS device.

## ✨ Driven by Visual Language Model

Midscene.js is all-in on the pure-vision route for UI actions: element localization and interactions are based on screenshots only. It supports visual-language models like `Qwen3-VL`, `Doubao-1.6-vision`, `gemini-3-flash`, and `UI-TARS`. For data extraction and page understanding, you can still opt in to include DOM when needed.

* Pure-vision localization for UI actions; the DOM extraction mode is removed.
* Works across web, mobile, desktop, and even `<canvas>` surfaces.
* Far fewer tokens by skipping DOM for actions, which cuts cost and speeds up runs.
* DOM can still be included for data extraction and page understanding when needed.
* Strong open-source options for self-hosting.

## Two styles of automation

### Auto planning

AI autonomously plans and executes the flow to complete the task.

```javascript
await aiAct('click all the records one by one. If one record contains the text "completed", skip it');
```

### Workflow style

Split complex logic into multiple steps to improve the stability of the automation code.

```javascript
const recordList = await agent.aiQuery('string[], the record list')
for (const record of recordList) {
  const hasCompleted = await agent.aiBoolean(`check if the record ${record}" contains the text "completed"`)
  if (!hasCompleted) {
    await agent.aiTap(record)
  }
}
```
