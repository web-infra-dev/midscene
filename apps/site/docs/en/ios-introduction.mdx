# iOS Automation Support

Thanks to the visual model approach, Midscene can drive WebDriver tools to support iOS automation.

Since it adopts a visual model approach, apps built with any technology stack can integrate with Midscene. Developers can directly target the final results and debug their UI automation scripts.

The iOS UI automation solution comes with all the features of Midscene:

- Supports zero-code trial using Playground.
- Supports JavaScript SDK.
- Supports automation scripts in YAML format and command-line tools.
- Supports HTML reports to replay all operation paths.
