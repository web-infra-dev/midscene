# Quick experience with iOS

By using Midscene.js playground, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on iOS devices, without needing to write any code.

The playground shares the same codebase as the `@midscene/ios` package, so you can consider it as a playground or debugging tool for the Midscene iOS SDK.
