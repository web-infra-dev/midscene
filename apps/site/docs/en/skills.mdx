# Control any platform with Skills

[Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) are a format for extending AI coding agents with specialized capabilities. Midscene provides Agent Skills that let AI coding tools (like Claude Code, Cline, etc.) drive UI automation through CLI commands — no MCP server setup required.

Unlike [MCP integration](./mcp), Skills work by running CLI commands directly in the terminal. The AI agent acts as the brain: it takes screenshots, analyzes the UI, and decides which actions to perform next.

## Supported platforms

| Skill | Package | CLI command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Browser Automation | `@midscene/web` | `npx @midscene/web` | Headless Chrome via Puppeteer, opens new browser tabs |
| Chrome Bridge Automation | `@midscene/web` | `npx @midscene/web --bridge` | User's own Chrome browser, preserves cookies and sessions |
| Desktop Computer Automation | `@midscene/computer` | `npx @midscene/computer` | macOS, Windows, Linux desktop control |
| Android Device Automation | `@midscene/android` | `npx @midscene/android` | Android device control via ADB |
| iOS Device Automation | `@midscene/ios` | `npx @midscene/ios` | iOS device control via WebDriverAgent |

## Installation

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed, then run:

```bash
# General installation
npx skills add web-infra-dev/midscene-skills

# Claude Code
npx skills add web-infra-dev/midscene-skills -a claude-code

# OpenClaw
npx skills add web-infra-dev/midscene-skills -a openclaw
```

## Model configuration

Midscene skills require a vision model with strong visual grounding capabilities. Configure the following environment variables — either as system environment variables or in a `.env` file in the current working directory (Midscene loads `.env` automatically):

```bash
MIDSCENE_MODEL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
MIDSCENE_MODEL_NAME="model-name"
MIDSCENE_MODEL_BASE_URL="https://..."
MIDSCENE_MODEL_FAMILY="family-identifier"
```

For supported models and configuration details, see [Model strategy](./model-strategy) and [Common model configuration](./model-common-config).

## Use skills

In your AI chat assistant, you can use the following command to use skills:

```markdown
Open photo app, see what is the first photo in the album.
```
