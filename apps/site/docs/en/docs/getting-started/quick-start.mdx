# Quick Start

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';


In this example, we use OpenAI GPT-4o to search headphones on eBay, and then get the result items and prices in JSON format. 

Remember to prepare an API key that is eligible for accessing OpenAI's GPT-4o before running.

## Preparation

Config the API key

```bash
# replace by your own
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

## Integrate with Playwright

> [Playwright.js](https://playwright.com/) is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft, primarily designed for end-to-end testing and web scraping of web applications.

We assume you already have a project with Puppeteer.

### add the dependency

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web --save-dev" />

### Step 1. update playwright.config.ts

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
+ timeout: 90 * 1000,
+ reporter: '@midscene/web/playwright-report',
});
```

### Step 2. extend the `test` instance

Save the following code as `./fixture.ts`;

```typescript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import type { PlayWrightAiFixtureType } from '@midscene/web';
import { PlaywrightAiFixture } from '@midscene/web';

export const test = base.extend<PlayWrightAiFixtureType>(PlaywrightAiFixture());
```

### Step 3. write the test case

Save the following code as `./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts`

```typescript title="./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts"
import { expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { test } from "./fixture";

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  page.setViewportSize({ width: 400, height: 905 });
  await page.goto("https://www.ebay.com");
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
});

test("search headphone on ebay", async ({ ai, aiQuery }) => {
  // ðŸ‘€ type keywords, perform a search
  await ai('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');

  // ðŸ‘€ find the items
  const items = await aiQuery(
    "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
  );

  console.log("headphones in stock", items);
  expect(items?.length).toBeGreaterThan(1);
});

```

### Step 4. run the test case

```bash
npx playwright test ./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts
```

### Step 5. view test report after running

Follow the instructions in the command line to server the report. 

```bash
# sample command
npx http-server ./midscene_run/report -p 9888 -o -s
```

## Integrate with Puppeteer

> [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Puppeteer runs in the headless (no visible UI) by default but can be configured to run in a visible ("headful") browser.

### Step 1. install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web puppeteer ts-node --save-dev" />

### Step 2. write scripts

Write and save the following code as `./demo.ts`.

```typescript title="./demo.ts"
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { PuppeteerAgent } from "@midscene/web";

const sleep = (ms: number) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
Promise.resolve(
  (async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      headless: false, // here we use headed mode to help debug
    });

    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewport({
      width: 1280,
      height: 800,
      deviceScaleFactor: 1,
    });

    await page.goto("https://www.ebay.com");
    await sleep(5000);

    // ðŸ‘€ init MidScene agent
    const mid = new PuppeteerAgent(page);

    // ðŸ‘€ type keywords, perform a search
    await mid.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');
    await sleep(5000);

    // ðŸ‘€ understand the page content, find the items
    const items = await mid.aiQuery(
      "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
    );
    console.log("headphones in stock", items);

    await browser.close();
  })()
);
```

:::tip
You may have noticed that the key lines of code for this only consist of two lines. They are all written in plain language.

```typescript
await mid.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');
await mid.aiQuery(
  '{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price',
);
```
:::

### Step 3. run

Using ts-node to run, you will get the data of Headphones on eBay:

```bash
# run
npx ts-node demo.ts

# it should print 
#  [
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'JBL Tour Pro 2 - True wireless Noise Cancelling earbuds with Smart Charging Case',
#     price: 551.21
#   },
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'Soundcore Space Oneæ— çº¿è€³æœº40H ANCæ’­æ”¾æ—¶é—´2XStrongerè¯­éŸ³è¿˜åŽŸ',
#     price: 543.94
#   }
# ]
```

### Step 4. view test report after running

After running, MidScene will generate a log dump, which is placed in `./midscene_run/report/latest.web-dump.json` by default. Then put this file into [Visualization Tool](/visualization/), and you will have a clearer understanding of the process.


## View demo report

Click the 'Load Demo' button in the [Visualization Tool](/visualization/), you will be able to see the results of the previous code as well as some other samples.
