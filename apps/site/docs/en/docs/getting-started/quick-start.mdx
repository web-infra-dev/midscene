# Quick Start

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

In this example, we use OpenAI GPT-4o to search headphones on eBay, and then get the result items and prices in JSON format. 

Remember to prepare an API key that is eligible for accessing OpenAI's GPT-4o before running.

## Preparation

Config the OpenAI API key, or [customize model vendor](../usage/model-vendor.html)

```bash
# replace with your own
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

## Experience with Command Line Tools

Command line version of Midscene is a very convenient way to experience the basics.

⁠Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# headless mode to visit bing.com and search for 'weather today'
npx @midscene/cli --url https://wwww.bing.com --action "type 'weather today', hit enter"

# headed mode (i.e. visible browser) to visit bing.com and search for 'weather today'
npx @midscene/cli --headed --url https://wwww.bing.com --action "type 'weather today', hit enter"

# visit github status page and save the status to ./status.json
npx @midscene/cli \
  --url https://www.githubstatus.com/ \
  --query-output status.json \
  --query '{name: string, status: string}[], service status of github page'
```

If you want to dive deep into Midscene, we recommend using the SDK version and integrating it with Playwright or Puppeteer.

### View test report after running

After running, Midscene will generate a log dump, which is placed in `./midscene_run/report/latest.web-dump.json` by default. Then put this file into [Visualization Tool](/visualization/), and you will have a clearer understanding of the process.

## Integrate with Playwright

> [Playwright.js](https://playwright.com/) is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft, primarily designed for end-to-end testing and web scraping of web applications.

We assume you already have a project with Puppeteer.

### add the dependency

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web --save-dev" />

### Step 1. update playwright.config.ts

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
+ timeout: 90 * 1000,
+ reporter: [["list"], ["@midscene/web/playwright-report"]],
});
```

### Step 2. extend the `test` instance

Save the following code as `./fixture.ts`;

```typescript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import type { PlayWrightAiFixtureType } from '@midscene/web/playwright';
import { PlaywrightAiFixture } from '@midscene/web/playwright';

export const test = base.extend<PlayWrightAiFixtureType>(PlaywrightAiFixture());
```

### Step 3. write the test case

Save the following code as `./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts`

```typescript title="./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts"
import { expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { test } from "./fixture";

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 });
  await page.goto("https://www.ebay.com");
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
});

test("search headphone on ebay", async ({ ai, aiQuery, aiAssert }) => {
  // 👀 type keywords, perform a search
  await ai('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');

  // 👀 find the items
  const items = await aiQuery(
    "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
  );

  console.log("headphones in stock", items);
  expect(items?.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

  // 👀 assert by AI
  await aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");
});

```

### Step 4. run the test case

```bash
npx playwright test ./e2e/ebay-search.spec.ts
```

### Step 5. view test report after running

After the above command executes successfully, the console will output: `Midscene - report file updated: ./current_cwd/midscene_run/report/some_id.html`. You can open this file in a browser to view the report.

## Integrate with Puppeteer

> [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Puppeteer runs in the headless (no visible UI) by default but can be configured to run in a visible ("headful") browser.

### Step 1. install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @midscene/web puppeteer ts-node --save-dev" />

### Step 2. write scripts

Write and save the following code as `./demo.ts`.

```typescript title="./demo.ts"
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { PuppeteerAgent } from "@midscene/web/puppeteer";

const sleep = (ms: number) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
Promise.resolve(
  (async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      headless: false, // here we use headed mode to help debug
    });

    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewport({
      width: 1280,
      height: 800,
      deviceScaleFactor: 1,
    });

    await page.goto("https://www.ebay.com");
    await sleep(5000);

    // 👀 init Midscene agent
    const mid = new PuppeteerAgent(page);

    // 👀 type keywords, perform a search
    await mid.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');
    await sleep(5000);

    // 👀 understand the page content, find the items
    const items = await mid.aiQuery(
      "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
    );
    console.log("headphones in stock", items);

    // 👀 assert by AI
    await mid.aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");

    await browser.close();
  })()
);
```

:::tip
You may have noticed that the key lines of code for this only consist of three lines. They are all written in plain language.

```typescript
await mid.aiAction('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');
await mid.aiQuery(
  '{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price',
);
await mid.aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");
```
:::

### Step 3. run

Using ts-node to run, you will get the data of Headphones on eBay:

```bash
# run
npx ts-node demo.ts

# it should print 
#  [
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'JBL Tour Pro 2 - True Wireless Noise Cancelling earbuds with Smart Charging Case',
#     price: 551.21
#   },
#   {
#     itemTitle: 'Soundcore Space One无线耳机40H ANC播放时间2XStronger语音还原',
#     price: 543.94
#   }
# ]
```

### Step 4: View the Run Report

After the above command executes successfully, the console will output: `Midscene - report file updated: ./current_cwd/midscene_run/report/some_id.html`. You can open this file in a browser to view the report.

Alternatively, you can import the `./midscene_run/report/latest.web-dump.json` file into the [Visualization Tool](/visualization/) to view it.

## View demo report

Click the 'Load Demo' button in the [Visualization Tool](/visualization/), you will be able to see the results of the previous code as well as some other samples.
