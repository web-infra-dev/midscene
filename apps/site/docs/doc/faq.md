#### About the token cost

Image resolution and element numbers (i.e., a UI context size created by MidScene) form the token bill.

Here are some typical data.

|Task | Resolution | Input tokens | Output tokens | GPT-4o Price |
|-----|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
|Find the download button on the VSCode website| 1920x1080| 2011|54| $0.011|
|Split the Github status page| 1920x1080| 3609|1020| $0.034|

The above price data was calculated in June 2024.

#### The automation process is running more slowly than it did before

Since MidScene.js will invoke the AI each time it performs planning and querying, the running time may increase by a factor of 5 to 10. This is inevitable for now, but it may improve with advancements in LLMs.

Despite the increased time and cost, MidScene stands out in practical applications due to its unique development experience and easy-to-maintain codebase. We are confident that incorporating automation scripts powered by MidScene will significantly enhance your projectâ€™s efficiency, streamline complex tasks, and boost overall productivity. By integrating MidScene, your team can focus on more strategic and innovative activities, leading to faster development cycles and better outcomes.

In short, it is worth the time and cost.
