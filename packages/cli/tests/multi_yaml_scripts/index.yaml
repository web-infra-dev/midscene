# Example batch execution index YAML file
# This demonstrates how to use the multi-YAML file batch execution feature

# Concurrency settings (default: 1 for sequential execution)
concurrent: 2

# Continue execution even if one file fails (default: false)
continueOnError: true

# Global web environment configuration (applied to all files)
web:
  # All individual YAML files will inherit these settings
  viewportWidth: 1280
  viewportHeight: 720
  # Output directory for individual files (will be combined with file-specific paths)
  # output: "./batch-results/"

# Global android environment configuration (if needed)
# android:
#   deviceId: "emulator-5554"

# Execution order using glob patterns
order:
  - "test-*.yaml"      # Execute all files starting with "test-"
  - "demo.yaml"        # Execute specific file
  - "scripts/*.yaml"   # Execute all YAML files in scripts directory

# Output configuration for the batch execution summary
output:
  path: "./batch-execution-result.json"
  format: "json"
