1. Format:

web:
  url: "starting_url"
  viewportWidth: 1280
  viewportHeight: 960

tasks:
  - name: "descriptive task name"
    flow:
      - aiTap: "element description"
      - aiInput: 'text value'
        locate: 'input field description'
      - aiScroll:
        direction: down/up
        scrollType: untilBottom/untilTop/page
      - aiAssert: "expected state"
      - sleep: milliseconds

2. Action Types:
- aiTap: for clicks (natural language targeting)
- aiInput: for text input with 'locate' field
- aiScroll: with direction and scrollType
- aiAssert: for validations
- sleep: for delays (milliseconds)

3. Best Practices:
- Group related actions into logical tasks
- Use natural language descriptions
- Add deepThink: true for complex interactions
- Keep task names concise but descriptive
