## üì¢ 2025 Feb: New open-source model choice - UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL

Besides the default model *GPT-4o*, we have added two new recommended open-source models to Midscene.js: *UI-TARS* and *Qwen2.5-VL*. (Yes, Open Source models !) They are dedicated models for image recognition and UI automation, which are known for performing well in UI automation scenarios. Read more about it in [Choose a model](https://midscenejs.com/choose-a-model).

## üí° Features
- **Natural Language Interaction üëÜ**: Just describe your goals and steps, and Midscene will plan and operate the user interface for you.
- **UI Automation ü§ñ**
  - **Web Automation üñ•Ô∏è**: Start in-browser experience immediately through [the Chrome extension](https://midscenejs.com/quick-experience.html), or integrate with [Puppeteer](https://midscenejs.com/integrate-with-puppeteer.html) and [Playwright](https://midscenejs.com/integrate-with-playwright.html).
  - **Android Automation üì±**: Use [the Android playground](https://midscenejs.com/quick-experience-with-android.html) to start experience immediately, or integrate javascript SDK with [adb](https://midscenejs.com/integrate-with-android.html).
- **MCP Integration üîó**: Allows other MCP Clients to directly use Midscene's capabilities. For more details, please read [MCP Integration](https://midscenejs.com/zh/mcp.html).
- **Visual Reports for Debugging üéûÔ∏è**: Through our test reports and Playground, you can easily understand, replay and debug the entire process.
- **Support Caching üîÑ**: The first time you execute a task through AI, it will be cached, and subsequent executions of the same task will significantly improve execution efficiency.
- **Completely Open Source üî•**: Experience a whole new automation development experience, enjoy!
- **Understand UI, JSON Format Responses üîç**: You can specify data format requirements and receive responses in JSON format.
- **Intuitive Assertions ü§î**: Express your assertions in natural language, and AI will understand and process them.

## ‚ú® Model Choices

You can use multimodal LLMs like `gpt-4o`, or visual-language models like `Qwen2.5-VL`, `gemini-2.5-pro` and `UI-TARS`. In which `UI-TARS` is an open-source model dedicated for UI automation.

## üëÄ Comparing to ...

There are so many UI automation tools out there, and each one seems to be all-powerful. What's special about Midscene.js?

* Debugging Experience: You will soon realize that debugging and maintaining automation scripts is the real challenge. No matter how magical the demo looks, ensuring stability over time requires careful debugging. Midscene.js offers a visualized report file, a built-in playground, and a Chrome Extension to simplify the debugging process. These are the tools most developers truly need, and we're continually working to improve the debugging experience.

* Open Source, Free, Deploy as you want: Midscene.js is an open-source project. It's decoupled from any cloud service and model provider, you can choose either public or private deployment. There is always a suitable plan for your business.

* Integrate with Javascript: You can always bet on Javascript üòé
