Midscene.js lets AI be your browser operator ü§ñ.Just describe what you want to do in natural language, and it will help you operate web pages, validate content, and extract data. Whether you want a quick experience or deep development, you can get started easily.


## Showcases

The following recorded example video is based on the [UI-TARS 7B SFT](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/UI-TARS-7B-SFT) model, and the video has not been sped up at all~

## üì¢ New open-source model choice - UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL

Besides the default model *GPT-4o*, we have added two new recommended open-source models to Midscene.js: *UI-TARS* and *Qwen2.5-VL*. (Yes, Open Source !) They are dedicated models for image recognition and UI automation, which are known for performing well in UI automation scenarios. Read more about it in [Choose a model](https://midscenejs.com/choose-a-model).

## üí° Features
- **Natural Language Interaction üëÜ**: Just describe your goals and steps, and Midscene will plan and operate the user interface for you.
- **Chrome Extension Experience üñ•Ô∏è**: Start experiencing immediately through the Chrome extension, no coding required.
- **Puppeteer/Playwright Integration üîß**: Supports Puppeteer and Playwright integration, allowing you to combine AI capabilities with these powerful automation tools for easy automation.
- **Support Open-Source Models ü§ñ**: Supports private deployment of [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars) and [`Qwen2.5-VL`](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL), which outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude in UI automation scenarios while better protecting data security.
- **Support General Models üåü**: Supports general large models like GPT-4o and Claude, adapting to various scenario needs.
- **Visual Reports for Debugging üéûÔ∏è**: Through our test reports and Playground, you can easily understand, replay and debug the entire process.
- **Support Caching üîÑ**: The first time you execute a task through AI, it will be cached, and subsequent executions of the same task will significantly improve execution efficiency.
- **Completely Open Source üî•**: Experience a whole new automation development experience, enjoy!
- **Understand UI, JSON Format Responses üîç**: You can specify data format requirements and receive responses in JSON format.
- **Intuitive Assertions ü§î**: Express your assertions in natural language, and AI will understand and process them.

## ‚ú® Model Choices

- You can use general-purpose LLMs like `gpt-4o`, it works well for most cases. And also, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `qwen-vl-max-latest` are supported.
- You can also use [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars) model, which is an **open-source model** dedicated for UI automation. You can deploy it on your own server, and it will dramatically improve the performance and data privacy.

## üëÄ Comparing to ...

There are so many UI automation tools out there, and each one seems to be all-powerful. What's special about Midscene.js?

* Debugging Experience: You will soon find that debugging and maintaining automation scripts is the real challenge point. No matter how magic the demo is, you still need to debug the process to make it stable over time. Midscene.js offers a visualized report file, a built-in playground, and a Chrome Extension to debug the entire process. This is what most developers really need. And we're continuing to work on improving the debugging experience.

* Open Source, Free, Deploy as you want: Midscene.js is an open-source project. It's decoupled from any cloud service and model provider, you can choose either public or private deployment. There is always a suitable plan for your business.

* Integrate with Javascript: You can always bet on Javascript üòé
