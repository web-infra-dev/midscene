## 📢 New open-source model choice - UI-TARS 

From version v0.10.0, we support a new open-source model named [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars). Read more about it in [Choose a model](https://midscenejs.com/choose-a-model).

## 💡 Features
- **Natural Language Interaction 👆**: Just describe your goals and steps, and Midscene will plan and operate the user interface for you.
- **Chrome Extension Experience 🖥️**: Start experiencing immediately through the Chrome extension, no coding required.
- **Puppeteer/Playwright Integration 🔧**: Supports Puppeteer and Playwright integration, allowing you to combine AI capabilities with these powerful automation tools for easy automation.
- **Support Private Deployment 🤖**: Supports private deployment of [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars) model, which outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude in UI automation scenarios while better protecting data security.
- **Support General Models 🌟**: Supports general large models like GPT-4o and Claude, adapting to various scenario needs.
- **Visual Reports for Debugging 🎞️**: Through our test reports and Playground, you can easily understand, replay and debug the entire process.
- **Support Caching 🔄**: The first time you execute a task through AI, it will be cached, and subsequent executions of the same task will significantly improve execution efficiency.
- **Completely Open Source 🔥**: Experience a whole new automation development experience, enjoy!
- **Understand UI, JSON Format Responses 🔍**: You can specify data format requirements and receive responses in JSON format.
- **Intuitive Assertions 🤔**: Express your assertions in natural language, and AI will understand and process them.

## ✨ Model Choices

- You can use general-purpose LLMs like `gpt-4o`, it works well for most cases. And also, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `qwen-vl-max-latest` are supported.
- You can also use [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars) model, which is an **open-source model** dedicated for UI automation. You can deploy it on your own server, and it will dramatically improve the performance and data privacy.

## 👀 Comparing to ...

There are so many UI automation tools out there, and each one seems to be all-powerful. What's special about Midscene.js?

* Debugging Experience: You will soon find that debugging and maintaining automation scripts is the real challenge point. No matter how magic the demo is, you still need to debug the process to make it stable over time. Midscene.js offers a visualized report file, a built-in playground, and a Chrome Extension to debug the entire process. This is what most developers really need. And we're continuing to work on improving the debugging experience.

* Open Source, Free, Deploy as you want: Midscene.js is an open-source project. It's decoupled from any cloud service and model provider, you can choose either public or private deployment. There is always a suitable plan for your business.

* Integrate with Javascript: You can always bet on Javascript 😎
