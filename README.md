## 📢 New open-source model choice - UI-TARS 

From version v0.10.0, we support a new open-source model named [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars). Read more about it in [Choose a model](https://midscenejs.com/choose-a-model).

- **Intuitive Assertion 🤔**: Make assertions in natural language; it’s all based on AI understanding.
- **Experience by Chrome Extension 🖥️**: Start immediately with the Chrome Extension. No code is needed while exploring.
- **Visualized Report for Debugging 🎞️**: With our visualized report file, you can easily understand and debug the whole process.
- **Totally Open Source! 🔥**: Experience a whole new world of automation development. Enjoy!

## ✨ Model Choices

- You can use general-purpose LLMs like `gpt-4o`, it works well for most cases. And also, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `qwen-vl-max-latest` are supported.
- You can also use [`UI-TARS`](https://github.com/bytedance/ui-tars) model, which is an **open-source model** dedicated for UI automation. You can deploy it on your own server, and it will dramatically improve the performance and data privacy.

## 👀 Comparing to ...

There are so many UI automation tools out there, and each one seems to be all-powerful. What's special about Midscene.js?

* Debugging Experience: You will soon find that debugging and maintaining automation scripts is the real challenge point. No matter how magic the demo is, you still need to debug the process to make it stable over time. Midscene.js offers a visualized report file, a built-in playground, and a Chrome Extension to debug the entire process. This is what most developers really need. And we're continuing to work on improving the debugging experience.

* Open Source, Free, Deploy as you want: Midscene.js is an open-source project. It's decoupled from any cloud service and model provider, you can choose either public or private deployment. There is always a suitable plan for your business.

* Integrate with Javascript: You can always bet on Javascript 😎
